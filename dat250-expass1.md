# Software Technology Experiment 1

Starting out I knew that I had most of the software already installed, however there might have been
a little while since I last updated them.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

The first thing I checked was if my IDE was updated. I have used IntelliJ IDEA for most of my
programming, so that is what I plan on using for this course as well. After launching IntelliJ on my
computer, I noticed my license was outdated, so I had to get that renewed. After renewing, I got a prompt
to update to the latest version 2021.2.1.

## Java Development Environment (JDK)

In order to check what java version I had installed, I opened the Command Prompt and typed:
`java --version`.
I had java version 13 installed and decided to download the newest version java 16.0.2 instead from 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

## Maven

For Maven, I used a similar command: `mvn --version` to check if I had Maven installed and what version.
Apache Maven 3.6.3 was already installed, so I did not bother updating that just yet.

## Git

I used the command: `git --version` in cmd to check what version of git I had installed, which turned
out to be the newest 2.33.
While I was using already using git, I made a new repository and added this markdown file.

## Heroku

I knew that I did not have Heroku installed, so I went over to 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java and followed the startup tutorial step
by step. I had no issues with any of the steps in the tutorial, however I did not complete the optional
step *Provision add-ons*.
