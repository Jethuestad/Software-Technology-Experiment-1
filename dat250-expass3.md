## Experiment 2: Aggregation

### Working example

![Map reduce example](pictures_3/map_reduce.png)
![Map reduce example from compass](pictures_3/map_reduce_compass.png)

### My own Map-reduce operation

![Map reduce with order date](pictures_3/map_reduce_date.png)
![Map reduce with order date from compass](pictures_3/map_reduce_date_compass.png)

This Map-reduce operation is usefull in order to see what dates each person
ordered something. This can be used to keep track of when someone bought
something.

In the collection you get an id which is the name of each person,
and a value which contains a list over all the times that person bought
items.

## Issues

I did not encounter any issues with this experiment.
