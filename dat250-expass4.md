# Software Technology Experiment 4


## Installation

I did not have any problems with importing the project or setting up postman.


## Experiment 1: Spark/Java Framework project and Postman
I had no problems with the testing in experiment 1 with postman

## Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items
This experiment was also rather straight forward and I had no difficulties while doing the tasks.

Below you can find some screen shots of the different requests:

![get](pictures_4/get.png)
![put](pictures_4/put.png)
![post](pictures_4/post.png)
![delete](pictures_4/del.png)

This is after running the request some times, and then get in the end to see all todo objects:
